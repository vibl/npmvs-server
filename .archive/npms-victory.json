Add Victory to your project:\n\n  ```sh\n  $ npm install victory --save\n  ```\n\n2. Add your first Victory component:\n\n  ```js\n  import React, { Component } from 'react';\n  import { render } from 'react-dom';\n  import { VictoryPie } from 'victory';\n\n  class PieChart extends Component {\n    render() {\n      return (\n        <VictoryPie />\n      );\n    }\n  }\n\n  render(<PieChart />, document.getElementById('app'));\n  ```\n\n3. `VictoryPie` component will be rendered, and you should see:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img align=\"center\" width=\"471\" alt=\"pie\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3719995/20915779/b51e3652-bb3c-11e6-8243-6e7521a59115.png\">\n</p>\n\n## Requirements\nProjects using Victory should also depend on [React][] and [prop-types][].\n\n## Victory Native\nWant to use `Victory` with React Native? Check out [victory-native](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-native)\nVictory Native shares most of its code with Victory, and has a nearly identical api!\n\n## [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n\n## Issues\n### Jest Snapshots\n\nIf you want to use [Jest snapshot testing](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots)\nwith Victory, you may encounter a problem where the Jest snapshot changes every time, due to a randomly generated `clipId`\nbeing used for a `VictoryClipContainer` group component.\nThe solution to this is to set a static `clipId` on your `VictoryClipContainer`.\n\nFor example, when creating a `VictoryLine` component, you can pass a `groupComponent` prop:\n```js\n<VictoryLine\n  groupComponent={<VictoryClipContainer clipId={1} />}\n/>\n```\n\nNow the `clipId` attached to your `VictoryLine` component will always be the same, and your snapshot will not change with each test run.\n\n[React]: https://facebook.github.io/react/\n[prop-types]:
